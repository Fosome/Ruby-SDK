## Installation

```ruby
gem 'wepay', '~> @@version@@'
```

And include it in your scripts:

```ruby
require 'wepay'
```

## Examples

```ruby
client_id = 'your_client_id'
client_secret = 'your_client_secret'
use_stage = true

wepay = WePay::Client.new(client_id, client_secret, use_stage)

# Get the OAuth 2.0 authorization URL. Send the user to this URL to authorize
# the application, then they will return to your `redirect_uri` with a code as
# a GET parameter.
redirect_uri = "http://myexamplesite.com/wepay"
redirect_to(wepay.oauth2_authorize_url(redirect_uri))

# Once you have the OAuth 2.0 code, you can request an access token.
response = wepay.oauth2_token(code, redirect_uri)
access_token = response['access_token']

# Make a call to the `/user` endpoint (which requires no parameters).
response = wepay.call('/user', access_token)

# You may also open a payment account for the user.
response = wepay.call('/account/create', access_token, {
  :name        => "test account",
  :description => "this is only a test"
})
```

## Testing

Firstly, run `bundle install` to download and install the dependencies.

You can run the tests as follows:

```bash
make test
```


## API Reference

The API Reference is generated by a tool called [YARD](http://yardoc.org). Once it's installed, you can generate
updated documentation by running the following command in the root of the repository.

```bash
make docs
```

## Contributing
Here's the process for contributing:

1. Fork Signer to your GitHub account.
2. Clone your GitHub copy of the repository into your local workspace.
3. Write code, fix bugs, and add tests with 100% code coverage.
4. Commit your changes to your local workspace and push them up to your GitHub copy.
5. You submit a GitHub pull request with a description of what the change is.
6. The contribution is reviewed. Maybe there will be some banter back-and-forth in the comments.
7. If all goes well, your pull request will be accepted and your changes are merged in.

```


## Deploying
The `Makefile` (yes, `Makefile`) has a series of commands to simplify the development and deployment process.

### `make`

Running `make` by itself will show you a list of available sub-commands.

```bash
$ make
all
docs
gem
install
pushdocs
pushgem
tag
test
version
```

### `make pushdocs`
You will need to have write-access to the `wepay/Ruby-SDK` repository on GitHub. You should have already set up:

* Your SSH key with your GitHub account.
* Had your GitHub user given write-access to the repository.

Then you can run:

```bash
make pushdocs
```

You can view your changes at <https://wepay.github.io/Ruby-SDK/>.

### `make pushgem`
You will need to have pulled-down the proper gem credentials first. When prompted, enter your
[RubyGems](http://rubygems.org) password.

Login and view your [RubyGems profile page](https://rubygems.org/profile/edit) to see the proper command.

Then you can run:

```bash
make pushgem
```

If you need to [add an additional gem owner](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8487218/how-to-add-more-owners-to-a-gem-in-rubygem):

```bash
gem owner wepay -a api@wepay.com
```

You can view your changes at <https://rubygems.org/gems/wepay>.

### `make tag`
You will need to have a [Keybase](https://keybase.io) account first, including setting-up the
[`keybase` CLI tool](https://keybase.io/docs/command_line/prerequisites).

Then you can run:

```bash
make tag
```

You can view your changes in the `SIGNED.md` file.
